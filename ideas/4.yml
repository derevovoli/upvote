title: Ultra cryptography
description: Ultra was the designation adopted by British intelligence in June 1941
  for wartime signals intelligence obtained by breaking high-level encrypted enemy
  radio and teleprinter communications at the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS)
  at Bletchley Park.[1] Ultra eventually became the standard designation among the
  western Allies for all such intelligence. The name arose because the intelligence
  obtained was considered more important than that designated by the highest British
  security classification then used (Most Secret) and so was regarded as being Ultra
  Secret.[2] Several other cryptonyms had been used for such intelligence.
